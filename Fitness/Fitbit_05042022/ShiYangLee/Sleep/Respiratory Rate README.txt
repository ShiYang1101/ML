The respiratory rate (or breathing rate) is the rate at which breathing occurs. This is usually measured in breaths per minute.

The "Respiratory Rate Summary" files include summaries of your respiratory rate during sleeps:

- timestamp: the wake time
- full_sleep_breathing_rate: the respiratory rate average for your entire sleep
- full_sleep_standard_deviation: measures the amount your respiratory rate variates during the entire sleep
- full_sleep_signal_to_noise: the signal-to-noise value for the entire sleep
- deep_sleep_breathing_rate: the respiratory rate average for your deep sleep periods
- deep_sleep_standard_deviation: measures the amount your respiratory rate variates during the deep sleep periods
- deep_sleep_signal_to_noise: the signal-to-noise value for the deep sleep periods
- light_sleep_breathing_rate: the respiratory rate average for your light sleep periods
- light_sleep_standard_deviation: measures the amount your respiratory rate variates during the light sleep periods
- light_sleep_signal_to_noise: the signal-to-noise value for the light sleep periods
- rem_sleep_breathing_rate: the respiratory rate average for your REM sleep periods
- rem_sleep_standard_deviation:measures the amount your respiratory rate variates during the REM sleep periods
- rem_sleep_signal_to_noise: the signal-to-noise value for the REM sleep periods
